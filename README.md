# Random-Graph-Generator
This is a script designed to create random graphs using the Erdos-Renyi model(s).

When you run the script, you will be able to choose from two options of graphs:
Erdos-Renyi lets you choose the number of nodes and the probability of an edge forming between every pait of nodes.
Uniform is teh same as Erdos-Renyi, but with the addition of letting you choose the number fo edges that will be in the graph.
